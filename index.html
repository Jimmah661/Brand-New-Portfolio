                    <p class="lead text-black font-weight-normal">I've been passionate about technology from a young
                        age. Building computers from scratch with
                        parts
                        salvaged from whatever I could get my hands on. After a brief foray into the world of artisinal
                        pizza
                        making I managed to get myself a job working on a 1st level support team for a national chain of
                        Hospitals.</p>

                    <p class="lead text-black font-weight-normal">After 3 years working in the support team I migrated
                        to an application support role, managing the
                        Learning Development system for the organisation. While it was an interesting job the scope
                        quickly
                        changed and it reached a point where I was no longer happy with the work I was doing. I decided
                        to move
                        on and found a role in Local Government working in Technical support again.</p>

                    <p class="lead text-black font-weight-normal">2 years later, on a whim, I entered into the
                        nationally televised baking show, "The Great
                        Australian Bake
                        Off", and managed to secure an audition. This was lucky because when I was attending the
                        audition in
                        Sydney I met a young woman by the name of Alexandra. I ended up staying in contact with her and
                        after I
                        made it onto the show and finished my run we began a relationship.</p>

                    <p class="lead text-black font-weight-normal">Two and a half years after that I've now moved cities,
                        gotten engaged and managed to work my way
                        up to an
                        upper level support role at the University of Melbourne. Looking for a new challenge I decided
                        to enrol
                        myself into a Coding Bootcamp offered by Monash university. Hopefully it will lead to my next
                        great
                        adventure.</p>
